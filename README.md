# Predicting Quaternary State of Protein Using Machine Learning and Interface Feature Encoding

### Introduction
 Given the large amount of protein sequence information available (nearly 8 million), it is crucial to develop a computational method to predict the oligomeric/quaternary state using only sequence data.To tackle this challenge, we have put forth a method that uses both interface properties and other sequence characteristics to predict the Quaternary State. By using properties of interface such as it's volume, surface area and planarity we are able to incorporate structural features as well. Given only sequence of the protein we are able to predict it's quaternary state, symmetry and quaternary state type (Homomer/Heteromer).

### ML Models used-
We used Logisitc regression, Decision Tree,Random Forest and XGBoost for our multiclass, multilabel classification problem.
